## Installation

To install this community node, follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) provided in the n8n community nodes documentation.

## Operations

This node supports the following operations with VTiger CRM:

- Create Entities
- Update Entities
- Retrieve Entities
- Query Entities
- List Types
- Delete Entities
- Describe Entity

## Credentials

The VTiger API requires authentication. You need to provide a username and an access key with sufficient privileges to perform operations on the entities. You can find the access key information under “My Preferences” in the CRM Web UI.

## Compatibility

This node has been tested with VTiger version 6.\* and is expected to work with VTiger version 7 as well.

## Usage

To effectively use this node, you should be familiar with the concepts of Entities, naming conventions, and module prefixes in VTiger. For the Query operation, a basic understanding of SQL is also required. You can refer to the official VTiger documentation to get a comprehensive understanding of the general usage of operations.

### Create and Update Operations

Create and Update operations require a `Body` input. This should be a valid JSON object with attribute names as keys and their corresponding values. You can obtain the attribute names using the `Describe` operation. Example:

```json
{
	"firstname": "John",
	"lastname": "Doe",
	"cf_1234": "Customer"
}
```

**For Create operations, the required fields must be provided.**

### Retrieve, Update and Delete operations

Retrieve and Update operations require an `Entity ID`. This must follow the API convention (MODULExID). Example:

`10x1234`

### Query operation

The Query operation requires a valid SQL query supported by the API to query an entity. Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Leads WHERE email LIKE '%@domain.com';
```

**Note that it ends with a semicolon**

You can refer to the limitations of the query [here](https://community.vtiger.com/help/vtigercrm/developers/third-party-app-integration.html#query-operation)
